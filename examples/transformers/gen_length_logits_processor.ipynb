      "\n",
      "1. Species: There are over 25 species of macaques, including rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides).\n",

      "2. Physical characteristics:\n",
      "   - Generally small to medium-sized monkeys with long tails\n",

      "   - Have strong limbs and sharp teeth suitable for climbing trees\n",

      "4. Intelligence: Known for their problem-solving abilities and complex social behaviors, such as using tools and learning from each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Diet: Omnivorous, feeding on fruits, leaves, flowers, insects, and occasionally small animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Habitat: Found in forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas across Southeast Asia and parts of East Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Conservation status: Many species face threats due to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Cultural significance: In many cultures, macaques have been domesticated for food, pets, and labor, though this practice has declined in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Research value: Used extensively in medical research due to their similar physiology to humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Communication: Use vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language to communicate within and between groups.\n",
